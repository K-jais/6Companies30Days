WE can use a priority queue(min heap) of 10 numbers and store first 10 numbers and then traverse the array from 11th number and then
check if smaller number in min heap is smaller than cuurent number of array then eliminate that number in priority queue and add that
current array element and if it is not small then move to the next element.
